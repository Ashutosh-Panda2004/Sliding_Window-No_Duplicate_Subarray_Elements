10 problems involving arrays, subarrays, sliding windows, and conditions on elements:

1. **Maximum Erasure Value**

   - **Description**: Find the maximum sum of a subarray with all unique elements.
   - **Concepts**: Sliding window, hash set to track unique elements.

2. **Subarray Sum Equals K**

   - **Description**: Find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to `k`.
   - **Concepts**: Prefix sums, hash map to store cumulative sums.

3. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**

   - **Description**: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
   - **Concepts**: Sliding window, hash map to track character indices.

4. **Minimum Size Subarray Sum**

   - **Description**: Find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is at least `s`.
   - **Concepts**: Sliding window, two pointers.

5. **Longest Subarray with Sum Divisible by K**

   - **Description**: Find the length of the longest subarray with sum divisible by `k`.
   - **Concepts**: Prefix sums, modulus operation, hash map.

6. **Subarrays with K Different Integers**

   - **Description**: Find the number of subarrays that contain exactly `k` different integers.
   - **Concepts**: Sliding window, counting subarrays with at most `k` different integers.

7. **Count Number of Nice Subarrays**

   - **Description**: Find the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers.
   - **Concepts**: Sliding window, prefix sums.

8. **Maximum Average Subarray I**

   - **Description**: Find the contiguous subarray of length `k` that has the maximum average.
   - **Concepts**: Sliding window, cumulative sum.

9. **Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element**

   - **Description**: Find the longest subarray of 1's you can get by deleting one element.
   - **Concepts**: Sliding window, tracking zero counts.

10. **Longest Repeating Character Replacement**

    - **Description**: Given a string and an integer `k`, find the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing at most `k` character replacements.
    - **Concepts**: Sliding window, frequency map.

These problems involve techniques like sliding windows, hash maps, sets, and two-pointer approaches to handle conditions related to subarrays or substrings under certain constraints. Practicing these problems will help you strengthen your understanding of array manipulation and efficient algorithms.
